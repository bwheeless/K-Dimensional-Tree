The implementation of the K-Dimensional Tree in main was derived from code found on GeeksForGeeks [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-dimensional-tree/). The test cases are improvements from ones seen in the sample code to showcase some of the capabilities of this data structure.\
It is important to note that this data structure is a barebone implementation and contains insertion functionality, find minimum, search, and deletion.


A K-Dimensional Tree (also known as K-D Tree) is a space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a K-Dimensional space. This data structure acts similar to a binary search tree with each node representing data in the multi dimensional space.
