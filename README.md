The implementation of the K-Dimensional Tree in main was derived from code found on GeeksForGeeks [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-dimensional-tree/). The test cases are improvements from ones seen in the sample code to showcase some of the capabilities of this data structure.\
It is important to note that this data structure is a barebone implementation and contains insertion functionality, find minimum, search, and deletion.


# What is a K-Dimensional Tree
A K-Dimensional Tree (also known as K-D Tree) is a space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a K-Dimensional space. This data structure acts similar to a binary search tree with each node representing data in the multi dimensional space.


# What is happening in the tests?
The tests are a way to test if the multi-dimensionality of the K-Dimensional Tree is holding up. \
In the test code we test:
1. Multi-dimensionality of the K-Dimensional Tree
2. Finding the minimum point in the K-D Tree
3. Using the search function to find a point in the K-D Tree and a point not in the K-D Tree
4. The deletion of a point in the K-D Tree
